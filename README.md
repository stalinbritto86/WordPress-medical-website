The front-end works done here are credited to 'HTML Codex'. For managing time, I use the template called 'DOT.NET - Digital Agency Website Template' which is downloaded from their official website.
Here am working on back-end focusing on PHP in my style for the better compatibility, and optimising the site for search engines (SEO).
